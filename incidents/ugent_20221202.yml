  Maintenance work to HPC-UGent Tier-2 systems has been extended (started 28 November 2022)
  
  Are currently unavailable:
  
  * all HPC-UGent Tier-2 login nodes
  
  * all HPC-UGent Tier-2 clusters
  
  * the shared storage (`$VSC_HOME`, `$VSC_DATA`, `$VSC_SCRATCH*`)
    
We are confronted with unexpected filesystem/network stability issues, making the clusters unreliable at the moment.
The Tier2 login nodes and all Tier2 clusters will remain unavailable until the problem is resolved.

What is going on?
During routine stress tests, we are seeing filesystem issues that can trigger an entire cluster to go offline.
Likely, this is the result of a bug in the parallel filesystem software, in unique combination with the kernel and network software stack versions.
In accord with our vendor IBM we are debugging this issue and hope to fix it as soon as possible.
At the same time, we are researching and preparing other scenarios to bring the clusters back up again.

Is the data safe on the HOME/DATA/SCRATCH filesystems?
The integrity of the storage is not at risk.
Only the clusters are unusable at the moment because of this bug.

Why wasnâ€™t this tested beforehand?
It was.
We have migrated to a fully supported software stack.
And tested this software stack thoroughly well before the maintenance.
However, this bug seemingly is triggered by a unique I/O pattern that only occurs in a real live system.
