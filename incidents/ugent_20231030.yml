  The "swalot" HPC-UGent Tier-2 cluster will be shut down end of October 2023, to make room for a new cluster.

  Only jobs that are guaranteed to finish by Mon 30 Oct 08:00 CET will still start.

  <strong>If you are still relying on swalot, please migrate your workloads to another cluster ASAP.</strong>
