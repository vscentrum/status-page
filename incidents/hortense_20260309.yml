  Updates to hardware configuration and software will be performed, mainly related to the high speed network and the I/O subsystem.

  <p>
  The following infrastructure and services will be unavailable during this period: Tier1 Compute Hortense in full, including all workernodes as well as login and debug nodes, and the dedicated Tier1 scratch filesystem.

  <p>
  Please be aware that during the maintenance period, you will not be able to access any data located on Tier1 Hortense system.

  We also would like to inform you, that for technical reasons, we will not be able to keep RHEL8 nodes anymore in the updated system, so we will have to upgrade all GPU nodes to RHEL9. We will not have a transition period as it happened for the CPU nodes, and some of the old GPU software will no longer be accessible. We do apologize for the inconvenience.
