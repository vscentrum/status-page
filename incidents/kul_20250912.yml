  <p>
  Access to the KU Leuven/UHasselt Tier2 systems is suspended.
  </p>
  <p>
  The access limitation applies to:
  <ul>
    <li> all KU Leuven Tier2 login nodes </li>
    <li> sessions through ondemand.hpc.kuleuven.be </li>
  </ul>
  The Tier-2 cluster will temporarily not be reachable.
  However, running jobs will not be affected.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>update 2025-09-16 09:00</b> The login nodes are accessible again. Further testing is done on the compute nodes. We expect to be gradually releasing nodes today.</li>
    <li><b>update 2025-09-16 13:45</b> Most compute nodes are now back in production. Nearly all remaining nodes will follow over the course of the next days. The wICE test nodes with Rocky 9 will however only be released at a later stage. Jobs using the "rocky9_pilot" reservation will therefore not start anytime soon.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
