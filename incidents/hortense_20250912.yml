  <strong>Update Mon 16 Sept 2025, 17:15 CEST</strong><br/>
  Majority of security updates completed,<br/>
  Access to Tier-1 Hortense via SSH and the web portal has been restored.
  All partitions except for the debug nodes were already released 16/09 at noon, jobs that were in the queue started running then.
  A bit more work is needed to make the debug nodes available again.
  </p>
  <p>
  Access to Tier1 systems is shut down with immediate effect.
  This is in response to a major security flaw in the kernel, which has been recently identified.
  </p>
  <p>
  Access limitation applies to:
  <ul>
    <li> all Tier1 login nodes </li>
    <li> the Tier1 web portal tier1.hpc.ugent.be </li>
    <li> the Tier1 HPC storage systems </li>
  </ul>
  All these systems will not be reachable.
  However, running jobs will not be affected.
  </p>
  <p>
  In the next few days, we will perform emergency maintenance procedures.
  If all goes well, the systems should be back up in the beginning of next week.
  </p>
