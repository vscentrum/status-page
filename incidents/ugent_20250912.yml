  <strong>Update Mon 16 Sept 2025, 18:19 CEST</strong><br/>
  Security updates for UGent Tier-2 systems + login nodes completed,<br/>
  access has been restored.
  </p>
  <p>
  Access to the UGent Tier2 systems is shut down with immediate effect.
  This is in response to a major security flaw in the kernel, which has been recently identified.
  </p>
  <p>
  Access limitation applies to:
  <ul>
    <li> all UGent Tier2 login nodes </li>
    <li> the Tier2 web portal login.hpc.ugent.be </li>
    <li> the Tier2 HPC storage systems at Ghent University </li>
  </ul>
  All these systems will not be reachable.
  However, running jobs will not be affected.
  </p>
  <p>
  In the next few days, we will perform emergency maintenance procedures.
  If all goes well, the systems should be back up in the beginning of next week.
  </p>
