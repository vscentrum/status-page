  <p>
  Access to the Brussels Tier2 systems is currently shut down. 
  This is in response to a major security flaw in the kernel that was recently identified.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Access limitation applies to:
  <ul>
    <li> All VUB Tier2 login nodes </li>
    <li> The VUB web portal <a href="https://portal.hpc.vub.be">portal.hpc.vub.be</a></li>
  </ul>
  All these systems will not be reachable.
  However, running jobs will not be affected.
  </p>
  
  <p>  
  All fixes are now ready for deployment. Cluster nodes will be upgraded as soon as they become idle.
  We expect login nodes to be back online by the end of Monday, 15th September,
  with the full Hydra cluster likely restored by Tuesday, 16th September.
  We can confirm that the security of Hydra has not been compromised.
