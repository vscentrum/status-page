  An urgent update needs to be installed on all systems that include NVIDIA GPUs.
  </p>
  <p>
  The nodes in the GPU and debug partitions have been put offline,
  so they can be drained to install the necessary updates and reboot them.
  </p>
  <p>
  We'll do what we can to make these partitions available again ASAP.
