  <p>
  In accord with vendor ATOS, several updates to hardware and software will be performed.
  </p>
  <p>
  The following infrastructure and services will be unavailable during this period: Tier1 Compute Hortense in full, including all workernodes as well as login and debug nodes, and the dedicated Tier1 scratch filesystem.
  </p>
  <p>
  During the maintenance, the (very) old Rome login and debug nodes (partition debug_rome) will also be decommissioned. This means that, after the maintenance, all login nodes will have Milan architecture.
