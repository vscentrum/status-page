  <p>wICE is migrated to Rocky Linux v9.6. We are running benchmarks to reassess the performance, and evaluate the acceptance. Hence, wICE is still unavailable. Similarly, OnDemand sessions will also not start on wICE. But, jobs pending in the queue stay on hold until the machine is released. The Genius cluster stays available.</p>
